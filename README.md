# Mission to Mars

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to scrape data from different websites and display it in a webpage. 

To run the files and scrape the data, first open a new terminal and navigate to the app.py file. Once in that folder, type 'python app.py' in the command line. This executes the app.py file and provides a location to view the index.html. This will almost always be 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/'. Copy this into your browser and hit enter. This will display the index.html file in the browser. Some of the data will display at this time, but some of the images will need to be scraped. Click the 'scrape' button at the top of the screen under the title Mission to Mars. This will run the scrape.py file and pull all fresh information to fill the webpage. To help clean up the webpage and make it look presentable, a few additions were added using bootstrap and styling. Background and text colors were added to improve visibility as well.
